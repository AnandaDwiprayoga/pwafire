## Contacts Picker API

 It allows a web application to access contacts from the device's native contacts manager. Like this, your web app 
 has access to your contacts' names, emails, and telephone numbers. You can specify if you want just one, 
 or multiple contacts, and if you want all the fields, or just a subset of names, emails, and telephone numbers.
