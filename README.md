Build Scalable Progressive Web Apps/First Experiences Today. We're Helping You Build Better For The Modern Web.

### About [pwafire.org](https://pwafire.org)

Our mission is to make your **webdev** environment fully stacked up for best web development practices with Progressive Web Apps. 

### Setting up the PWA Development Environment 

We have a **PWA Developer Tips** [repo available here](https://github.com/mayeedwin/pwadev-tips) to help guide you if you're just starting up or want to have your setup checklist done right âœ…

### [What's NEW? ]()

### v 4.0.6

### Contacts Picker API

**Note : Chrome 77 or higher running on Android M or later required!**

It allows a web application to access contacts from the device's native contacts manager. Like this, your web app 
has access to your contacts' names, emails, and telephone numbers. 

### How to setup?

1. In your **App**, create an empty **contactPicker.js** file and copy and paste [this code snippet to it](https://github.com/pwafire/pwafire/blob/master/bundle/contact-picker/src/contactPicker.js) to it. Then save your chnages!

2. Remember to add the contact picker button element to your web page.

```html
<!-- Add this button to your App -->
 <button id="contact-picker"> Pick Contacts </button>
```

### Get Started with PWA Fire Bundle
[PWA Fire Bundle](https://twitter.com/pwafire) is an open source [Progressive Web App](https://maye.pwafire.org/articles/building-progressive-web-apps-with-pwafiredev-resources/) Tooling [Bundle](https://github.com/mayeedwin/pwafire/tree/master/bundle/) that provides you with resources to build [Progressive Web Apps](https://maye.pwafire.org/articles/building-progressive-web-apps-with-pwafiredev-resources/) with good web practices. 

It is the most simplest way you can ever convert your web app or website into a 100% [Progressive Web App](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-progressive-web-app-get-started-now-canaan-maye-edwin/) and still have some fun with the code. It doesn't make you a lazy code beast.

### What to do first // Required
Create two empty files in your project's root folder ; `service-worker.js` and `app.webmanifest`. N/B: Make sure to make the configuration changes as documented below.

### Configuration // setup
