## [Project PWA Fire üê∞](https://pwafire.org)

We just announced [PWA Fire Bundle 4.0.0](https://github.com/mayeedwin/pwafire/) which allows you to build a progressive web app more easily and in a more fun way. 

### [What's NEW?]()
1. In this release, we are using [workbox;](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/) which is a set of libraries and Node modules that make it easy to cache assets and take full advantage of features used to build Progressive Web Apps. 
	
### Get Started with PWA Fire Bundle
Project [PWA Fire](https://twitter.com/pwafire) is an open source [Progressive Web App](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-progressive-web-app-get-started-now-canaan-maye-edwin/) **javascript** and **json** [Bundle](https://github.com/mayeedwin/pwafire/tree/master/pwafire-bundle/default) made by [Maye Edwin](https://twitter.com/MayeEdwin1) that allows you to convert your website into a [Progressive Web App](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-progressive-web-app-get-started-now-canaan-maye-edwin/) or build one in a few. 

It is the most simplest way you can ever convert your web app or website into a 100% [Progressive Web App](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-progressive-web-app-get-started-now-canaan-maye-edwin/) and still have some fun with the code. It doesn't make you a lazy code beast.
