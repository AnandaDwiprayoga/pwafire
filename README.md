## About [pwafire.org](https://pwafire.org)

Our mission is to make your **webdev** environment fully stacked up for best web development practices with Progressive Web Apps.

## [What's NEW? ]() => v 4.0.6

### Contacts Picker API

**Note : Chrome 77 or higher running on Android M or later required!**

It allows a Web Application to access contacts from the device's native contacts manager. Your Web App 
has access to your contacts' names, emails, and telephone numbers. 

### How to setup?

1. In your **App**, create an empty **contactPicker.js** file and copy and paste [this code snippet to it](https://github.com/pwafire/pwafire/blob/master/bundle/contact-picker/src/contactPicker.js) to it. Then save your chnages!

2. Remember to add the contact picker button element to your web page.

```html
<!-- Add this button to your App -->
 <button id="contact-picker"> Pick Contacts </button>
```
