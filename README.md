Build Scalable Progressive Web Apps/First Experiences Today : ) 


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/mayeedwin/pwafire.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/mayeedwin/pwafire)

### [What's NEW?]()
We just announced [PWA Fire Bundle 4.0.0](https://github.com/mayeedwin/pwafire/) which allows you to build a progressive web app more easily and in a more fun way. 

1. In this release, we are using [workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/) - which is a set of libraries and Node modules that make it easy to cache assets and take full advantage of features used to build Progressive Web Apps. 

2. Use of [PWA Fire App](https://pwafire.org/developer/app) - Starter Web App Designed With Progressive Web App Best Practices And Packaged Ready For [Your PWA Project](https://pwafire.org/developer/app/)

### Get Started with PWA Fire Bundle
[PWA Fire Bundle](https://twitter.com/pwafire) is an open source [Progressive Web App](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-progressive-web-app-get-started-now-canaan-maye-edwin/) **javascript** and **json** [Bundle](https://github.com/mayeedwin/pwafire/tree/master/pwafire-bundle/default) that allows you to convert your website into a [Progressive Web App](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-progressive-web-app-get-started-now-canaan-maye-edwin/) or build one in a few. 

It is the most simplest way you can ever convert your web app or website into a 100% [Progressive Web App](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-progressive-web-app-get-started-now-canaan-maye-edwin/) and still have some fun with the code. It doesn't make you a lazy code beast.
